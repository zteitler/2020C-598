## Alumni panel

The Graduate Seminar will feature a panel of alumni from our
master's degree program.

* Sage Shaw
* Heather Wilber
* Andrew Misseldine

They are currently in PhD programs in mathematics,
and in the mathematics faculty at SUU.
This broad range of experience
makes it a very exciting opportunity to hear about the experiences
during and after the M.S. program, and the advice they can share with
new M.S. students.

They will discuss their experiences and advice, then there will be some
time for Q&A.
