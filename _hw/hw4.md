This assignment is to find out about different societies, groups, sites, and institutions
that are part of the mathematical community.

## Assignment

Choose **three** of them to learn about.
Write a brief description of each one, a few sentences or a paragraph:
what is this group, what does it do, what is something interesting about it.
The total length might be around a page.
Write your descriptions in LaTeX, form a PDF, and submit the PDF in BlackBoard.

## The groups

There are many societies, groups, etc., in mathematics,
playing different roles and with different aims.
Just a few examples are here:

1. Major professional societies:
   [AMS](https://www.ams.org/),
   [MAA](https://www.maa.org),
   [NCTM](https://www.nctm.org),
   [SIAM](https://www.siam.org),
   [ASA](https://www.amstat.org),
   [ASL](http://aslonline.org),
   and more.
   There are even more societies internationally or in other countries:
   mathematics societies of [Canada](https://cms.math.ca),
   [Europe](http://www.euro-math-soc.eu),
   [Australia](https://austms.org.au), etc.

2. Groups that support diversity in the mathematical community, such as
   [AWM](https://awm-math.org),
   [NAM](https://www.nam-math.org),
   and [Spectra](http://lgbtmath.org);
   sites like
   [Lathisms](https://www.lathisms.org)
   and [Mathematically Gifted & Black](https://mathematicallygiftedandblack.com).

3. Research institutes and summer workshops such as
   [MSRI](https://www.msri.org/),
   [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu),
   [AIM](https://aimath.org),
   [PCMI](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi),
   and more.

Choose one from each of the three categories.
You don't have to choose a listed one.
In fact I will be very happy if you find
ones that I didn't even know about.

This is informal writing.
Write a description of each group/society/whatever
that would make sense to a math student or teacher.


## Formatting

Please use LaTeX and produce a PDF.
For readability, please:

+ Use margins of at least 1" (2.5cm)

+ Use a 12pt option such as `\documentclass[12pt]{article}`

+ Use `\linespread{2.4}` to get double-spaced lines

+ Include your name in the PDF!
