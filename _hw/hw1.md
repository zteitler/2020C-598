This assignment is preparation for a discussion of the
degree requirements for the Mathematics M.S. program,
and how to get ready to complete them.

1. Locate and open the shared Google Drive
   "BSU Math Graduate Student Resources".
   You may have to sign in with your BSU login.
   
   This shared drive contains resources such as forms
   and thesis templates.
   
2. Read the "Flow Chart for Graduate Students" in that drive.
   (This will be the main topic of discussion.)

3. Read the "Graduation Procedures" in that drive.
   The details are *not important right now*.
   They will become important only when you are getting ready for graduation.
   Rather, the point is just to be aware that the details exist.
