This assignment is to locate some community-oriented resources online,
and the BSU Mathematics Master's Theses archive.
Please visit the sites listed below.
You don't have to turn in anything.

1. Visit the [Mathematics M.S. thesis archive](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/math_gradproj/).
   Choose 3 theses/projects from within the last 3 years. Please write one page:
     1. What information is given on the website for each thesis/project? How do you see the actual thesis/project file?
     1. What topics are they on? How specific/general are the topics?
     1. How many pages long are they? Do they have figures (illustrations)?
     1. What are some things that they have in common?
     1. Read the abstract and at least one page of the introduction of your 3 chosen theses/projects.
   

1. Visit [AMS for Students](https://www.ams.org/programs/students/students).
   Check out the categories of information, such as Internship and Co-Op Opportunities.

2. Visit [AMS Career Information](https://www.ams.org/profession/career-info/career-index).

3. Visit the [AMS Grad Student Blog](https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/)
   (although it's oriented toward Ph.D. graduate students)
   and the [AMS PhD + epsilon Blog](https://blogs.ams.org/phdplus/)
   (oriented toward early academic career).


Unfortunately the Young Mathematician's Network seems to be more or less abandoned.
They have gone through at least two websites which are abandoned, and a Facebook group,
which seems to also be abandoned.

If you find any websites, groups, or blogs that are relevant or interesting
for master's-degree students in mathematics, please share them!
